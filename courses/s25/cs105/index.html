            <p> This course is designed for students with little or no programming experience. A good
                understanding of high school-level algebra is helpful. </p>
                
            <p> This course is an introduction to computer science with emphasis on problem-solving, programming, and algorithm design and development.
                Topics include basic programming techniques, approaches to algorithm design, and techniques for
                understanding the process of computation and the correctness of software. The language for this course is Python 3.</p>
            
            <h3>Learning Objectives:</h3> A student successfully completing this course will:
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand basic approaches to algorithm design</li>
                    <li>Understand the use of basic building blocks of computer programs (expressions, functions, loops, built-in data structures)</li>
                    <li>Be able to practice fundamental techniques for understanding the execution of software (e.g., use of a debugger), and its correctness (e.g., methodical testing)</li>
                    <li>Achieve basic familiarity with navigating a computer from the command line</li>
                </ul>

<h2 id="grading">Grading Policies</h2>

Grades will be weighted as follows:<br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>40%</td>
        <td>Assignments</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>30%</td>
        <td>Midterms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>20%</td>
        <td>Final Project (including presentation)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>10%</td>
        <td>Attendance & Participation</td>
    </tr>

</table>
<br>
Participation includes participation in the online discussion board, participation during class lectures, and participation in in-class discussion.
Final grades will follow the standard Haverford grading scale.


<h3>Quizzes and Exams</h3>

<p>We will have short quizzes and excercises during class. Be ready to work on them by completing the weekly reading before class on Thursdays.

    <p>There will be two in-class midterms.
        In lieu of a final exam, there will be a final project and associated presentation.
        You must pass at least one exam to pass the course overall.

        <p>

            <h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>
            Lab assignments will generally be released on Tuesday, introduced on Thursday during lab time, and due the following Thursday at midnight.
            <span style="background-color:yellow"><b>Lab attendance is required</b></span>, and missing labs will quickly affect
            your participation grade. You will usually work on labs with a partner, and
            lab in general is a time to build community around the course and the material. Please note that I will often be off campus on Friday, and make use of office hours (both mine and the TAs) and Piazza for questions.
            In addition to the listed office hours, <b>lab monitors are available for help in KINSC H110 every Sunday - Thursday from 7-11pm.</b>

                <br>
                Labwork should be done on the computers in the computer science teaching lab (KINSC H110 or H204) either in person or by logging in remotely.
                We will help you learn how to login and access the lab during your first lab session. You may also find the following documents useful:
                <ul>

                <h3>Late Policy:</h3>
                <p>Each individual will be given <b>4 late days for the semester</b>.
                A late day is a 24 hour extension from the original deadline.
                You can use <b>up to one late day on any one assignment</b>. This will
                encompass any reason - illness, interviews, many midterms in the same week, etc. Past these days,
                late assignments will not be accepted. You should budget your days to account for future illnesses or assignment
                deadlines for other courses. Even if you do not fully complete a lab assignment you
                should submit what you have done to receive partial credit. </p>

                <p> For extensions beyond these 4 late days (in the case of an emergency or ongoing personal issue),
                please contact your <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/deans-office/contact-staff">Class Dean</a>.
                If your Class Dean notifies me of the issues, then we can arrange an accommodation. </p>

                <h3>From the faculty:</h3>
                <p>

                    In a community that thrives on relationships between students and faculty that
                    are based on trust and respect, it is crucial that students understand a
                    professor's expectations and what it means to do academic work with integrity.
                    Plagiarism and cheating, even if unintentional, undermine the values of the
                    <a href="http://honorcouncil.haverford.edu/the-code/">Honor Code</a> and the
                    ability of all students to benefit from the academic freedom
                    and relationships of trust the Code facilitates. Plagiarism is using someone
                    else's work or ideas and presenting them as your own without attribution.
                    Plagiarism can also occur in more subtle forms, such as inadequate paraphrasing,
                    failure to cite another person's idea even if not directly quoted, failure to
                    attribute the synthesis of various sources in a review article to that author,
                    or accidental incorporation of another's words into your own paper as a result
                    of careless note-taking. Cheating is another form of academic dishonesty, and
                    it includes not only copying, but also inappropriate collaboration, exceeding
                    the time allowed, and discussion of the form, content, or degree of difficulty
                    of an exam. Please be conscientious about your work, and check with us if anything
                    is unclear.

                                Under no circumstances may you hand in work done with (or by) someone else under
                                your own name. Your code should never be shared with anyone; you may not examine
                                or use code belonging to someone else, nor may you let anyone else look at or
                                make a copy of your code. While it is natural to consult online sources, students should not copy source code or attempt to find solutions online.
                                You may not share solutions after the due date of the assignment.

                                <b>Discussing ideas and approaches to problems with others on a general level is fine (in

                                    but you should
                                    never read anyone else's code or let anyone else read your code.</b>
                                All code you submit
                                must be your own with the following permissible exceptions: code distributed
                                in class,
                                code found in the course text book, and code worked on with an assigned partner. In
                                these cases, you should always include detailed comments that indicates on which parts
                                of the assignment you received help, and what your sources were. </p>

                            <span style="background-color:yellow"><b>Github copilot</b></span> (or any other software for automaticallly generating code) is not allowed for this course. 
                            Students must solve problems on their own to become proficient.
                            Furthermore, code generation tools often create code that is not well understood by the user, which can then become incorrect in the larger context of the program.

                                We'll be using Piazza, an online Q&A forum for class discussion, to help with labs, clarifications, and
                                announcements. You will receive an email invitation to join CMSC H105 on Piazza. If you don't, please let me know.

                                    Questions asked on Piazza are almost always answered faster than questions asked via e-mail.

                                    and answer questions on Piazza, but keep in mind the following guidelines:

                                    <ol>
                                        <li> Piazza should be used for ALL content and logistics questions outside of
                                            class, lab, and office hours. Please do not email
                                            me your code or extended questions about the assignments.
                                        <li> If there is a personal issue that relates only to you, please email me.

                                            classmates, not the instructors).
                                        <li> Do not post long blocks of code on Piazza &mdash; if you can distill the
                                            problem to 1-2 lines of code and an error message, that's fine, but try to
                                            avoid giving out key components of your work.
                                        <li> By the same token, when answering a question, try to give some guiding
                                            help but do not post code fixes or explicit solutions to the problem.

 to discuss and address those stressors with you in order to find solutions together.  If you are
 experiencing challenges or questions related to emotional health, finances, physical health, relationships,
  learning strategies or differences, or other related topics, we hope you will consider reaching out
   to the many resources available on campus. These resources include CAPS (free and unlimited counseling
   is available), Office of Academic Resources, Writing Center, Student Diversity Equity and Access Team, Health Services, Professional Health Advocate,
   Religious and Spiritual Life, the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the GRASE Center, and the Dean's

Additionally, Haverford College is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs
of its diverse student body and providing equitable access to students with disabilities. If you have (or think you may have)
a disability related to mental health, chronic health, neurological state, and/or physical condition &ndash; please contact the Office of Access
and Disability Services (ADS) at <a href="mailto:hc-ads@haverford.edu">hc-ads@haverford.edu</a>. It is never too late to request ADA accommodations &ndash; our bodies and circumstances
are continuously changing. Please know that all inquiries and health-related information is handled in a sensitive and confidential manner.

<p></p>
<strong>Students who have already been approved to receive academic ADA accommodations and want to use these in this course should share their accommodation letter
and make arrangements to meet with me as soon as possible to discuss how their accommodations will be implemented in this course.
Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice in order to successfully implement.</strong>

<p>

<i>It is a state law in Pennsylvania that individuals must be given advance notice that they may be recorded. Therefore, any student who has a disability-related need to audio record this class must first be approved for this ADA accommodation by Access and Disability Services and then must communicate approval to me.  I will then make a general announcement to the class that audio recording may occur while respecting students’ right to privacy by not identifying the individual(s).
